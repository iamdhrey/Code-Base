2. dont lose motivation.
3. dont learn in isolation.
4. do lot os code challenge

// THINK LIKE A DEVELOPER

/* WHENEVER THERE IS A PROBLEM, DONT
jumps at the problem without much thinking
implements his solution in an unstructured way
gets stressed out when things don‚Äôt work
Be too proud to research solutions

FIX
üëç Stay calm and slow down, don‚Äôt just jump at a problem without a plan
üëç Take a very logical and rational approach (programming is just logic, in the end‚Ä¶)
üëç Use my 4-step framework to solve any problem

1. understand the problem.
2. Divide and conquer. take big problem and break them down to small problems
3. dont be afraid to research problem. use google, stackoverflow, mdn web docs
4. for bigger problem, write pseudo code before writting actual code
meaning wright a humman readable code before you code.
5. develop curiousity on how things work.
